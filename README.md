# Butterflidentifier

Use Create ML to train a butterfly identifier on the dataset from https://www.josiahwang.com/dataset/leedsbutterfly

* The object classifier tool was used to train the model.

* A butterfly can be uploaded to the app and a prediction on which butterfly it is will be made.

* Reuses the image picker from my TudorBank repository.
